        Instructions
    </h3>

    <p>
        You will be grouped randomly and anonymously with
        another {{ C.NUM_OTHER_PLAYERS }}
        participants.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of you decides independently and simultaneously whether you will
        volunteer or not. If at least one of you volunteers, everyone will get
        {{ C.GENERAL_BENEFIT }}. However, the volunteer(s) will
        pay {{ C.VOLUNTEER_COST }}. If no one
        volunteers, everyone receives {{ C.NO_VOLUNTEER_PAYOFF }}.

        Each of you will also be given a random balance between 0 and 10. Before you choose to volunteer, you will see the 
        min-max range of the balances in your group. The game will run for three rounds.
